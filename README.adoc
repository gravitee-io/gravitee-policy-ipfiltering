== Description
The IP Filtering policy lets you control access to your API via IP addresses.
You can allow or deny a specific IP address or a range of IP by using https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1519[CIDR].

The whitelist mode excludes all IPs excepts those with an IP which is part of the whitelist.
The blacklist mode allows all IPs excepts those with an IP which is part of the blacklist.

If an IP is part of the blacklist and the whitelist, the policy reject the request.

You can specify a host to be resolved and checked against the remote IP.

== Configuration
You can configure the policy with the following options :

|===
